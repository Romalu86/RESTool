# RESTool 2.0 by romalu86

**Changelist:**
- Fixed file reading logic. Now it requires much less time and resources to unpack the data.
- Interface update. Technical unpacking mode names have been removed, and tooltips have been added when hovering over interface elements.
- Updated variable dictionary. Data from the latest update on AS1 - World (v5.2.7) has been added.
- Removed double tabulation between values. Now the unpacked data is arranged more compactly.
- Fixed an issue with the filename when using the "Objects Extended Engine" compiler mode.

**How to use?**

Due to the complete abandonment of the console, the user experience should improve. All processes are automated, and you will only need to start the program, select the file, and choose the unpacking mode. The program will take care of the rest for you. In case of any issues, all operations will be canceled and indicated in the messages and logs.

**Dictionary of variables:**

The program supports the ability to supplement the base of unknown variables that are unpacked in the INT format (numbers - 1, 2, 4, etc.) or hexadecimal number system (example 0x1000). All information is in the 'Data\constants.ini' file, new values are added by analogy with others.
