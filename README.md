**How to use?**

The program works through the console. For unpacking, you need to create a bat file. Its structure consists of three variables.

example: RESTool objects.res as1pad

The archive includes demo bat files, and RES files for testing. The specified objects.res file must be located on the path specified in the batch file or in the same folder with the program if the path is not specified.
After Bat File completes the work, 4 files will appear in the folder: OBJ.ini, WEAP.ini, CNST.ini and SFX.ini
